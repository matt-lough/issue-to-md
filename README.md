# Issues to markdown

## Install

```
$ bundle install
```

### Troubleshoot

* If you're running Linux and having trouble running `bundle install`, make sure you have `ruby-dev` installed in your environment (e.g. `apt-get install ruby-dev`).

## Usage

* Run `$ ruby main.rb`
* Type/paste the Github repository path (e.g.: `matt-lough/issue-to-md`) when
  prompted
* (Optional) Add your Github `ACCESS_TOKEN` on the `.env` file if you have
  issues with rate limiting or need access to a private repo
